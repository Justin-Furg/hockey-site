  <p>Although there are hundreds of diferent sticks out on the market, these are the best hockey stick that were recommended by pro's in 2018. According to Hockey Monkey, one of the worlds leading
suppliers of hockey gear, the best composite hockey stick is the <b>Warrior Covert QRL</b>. This stick is #1 for many reasons. One reason being that it is durable and versitile. With a total of 6 different blade
patterns, the covert QRL can adapt to multiple types of play. Whether you are a defensemen or a forward, you will love the QRL because of the low-kick point and the slighty open md-heel curve. The Covert QRL is
known for being lightweight and durable, great for puck-handlers, available with multiple blade face options, and great stick for scorers and skill players. The second best stick is the <b>Bauer Nexus 1N</b>.
This stick is available for virtually any type of play with the 8 blade patterns, the mid-kick piont making it one of the best sticks for slap shots, and the light weight adding for the ability of a
qucik snap shot. The 1N is known for one-piece construction, above-par durability ratings, and eight blade faces to choose from. The next stick is the <b>CCM RibCor Trigger2 PMT Grip</b>. This stick
has an enhanced flex zone and optimized ribcor low kick, which means skaters can easily store energy in both upper and lower areas of the shaft. The Trigger2 is marked by fused single piece construction
with Sigmatex carbon fiber, optimized low kick point, and new Ascent Blade 3 construction. Most of the other sticks also feature lightweight, durable shafts, extremely good control, and multiple blade and flex
options.</p>

  <h2>Gloves</h2>
  <ol type="1"><b>The Best Gloves of 2018</b>
    <li>Bauer Vapor 1X — 15.9 percent of NHL players</li>
    <li>Warrior Covert QRL — 8.4 percent of NHL players</li>
    <li>CCM HG12 — 8.3 percent of NHL players</li>
    <li>Warrior Dynasty AX1 — 7.7 percent of NHL players</li>
    <li>CCM CL Pro — 7.0 percent of NHL players</li>
  </ol>

    <p>When deciding what gloves to pick you usually go off of preference, but these gloves are highly recommended by NHL players. The #1 worn gloves in the NHL are the <b>Bauer Vapor 1X's</b>. This glove
is notable for its three layers of foam, of varying densities. Bauer claims to use the fastest-drying fabric in hockey. Also, the Free Flex cuff is designed for more flexibility and a wider fit to enhance
stick-handling. Some notable players using these gloves are: Nikita Kucherov, Taylor Hall, and Patrik Laine. The next best pair of gloves are the <b>Warrior Covert QRL's</b>. As we saw before, the QRL was also #1
for sticks and there is clearly a correlation between Warrior and good products. The most popular of Warrior’s seven glove models to see ice time in the NHL is all about the cuff. The company bills its
“AxyFlex” cuff as a floating cuff that covers the wrist from slashes and slides out of the way during stick-handling. Some otable players using these gloves are: Johnny Gaudreau, Nicklas Backstrom, and
Ryan Getzlaf. The next best gloves, coming just slightly behind the QRL's in terms of player percentage, are the <b>CCM HG12's</b>. Besides the traditional three padding segments across the fingers, the
HG12 has seven separate padding segments on the back of the hand. NHL players using these gloves are: Evgeny Kuznetsov, Filip Forsberg, and Jonathan Marchessault. The 4th recommended glove are the <b>Warrior Dynasty AX1's</b>.
These are also Warrior gloves with 7.7% of NHL players wearing them. The Alpha QX line, introduced in 2017, hasn’t managed to eclipse the Dynasty, a popular choice with defensemen. Notable players using
the AX1's are: Brad Marchand, Michael Frolik, and Zdeno Chara. The last, but certainly not lesat, pair of gloves on the list are the <b>CCM CL Pro's</b>. CL stands for “crazy light,” which is the drawing
card of this glove. Thirty-six percent of the league wears CCM gloves, and between the CL Pro and the CL 500, nearly a quarter of that share is in the “Crazy Light” line. Also, some notable players using
these gloves are: Jake Gardiner, Brent Burns, and Seth Jones. Although these gloves are the most worn in the NHL, there are many other gloves that work just as great and have a great look as well!
