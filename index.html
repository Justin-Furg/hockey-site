  <h1>The History of Hockey</h1>
  <p> When you think of hockey most people think of it originating from Canada, this is somewhat correct. Historical records show that a form of the game was played in Egypt 4,000 years ago and in
Ethiopia around 1,000 BC. An ancient form of the game was also played in Iran in around 2,000 BC. Some museumes also have evidence that the game was played by the Romans, Greeks, and Aztecs many
centuries before Columbus arrived in the New World. The modern game of hockey evolved in England in the 18th century. In 1876 the first hockey association was created and they made all the rules and
a leauge. Meanwhile in Canada, at Kings College in Windsor, many of the students began to develop a game similar to Hockey in the 1800's. Soon after the boys at Kings College invented the game,
soldiers at Fort Edward in Windsor took up the game and moved it to Halifax. There is even newspaper evidence of stories of the early game of hockey. Hockey was introduced into the olympics in 1908
and was unfortunatley dropped by the next games in 1912. It then came back in 1920 after there was pressure from Belgian hockey advocates, and has been an official Olympic sport since. Hockey is
commonly played in Canada and in other countries. The game of hockey has grown so much and turned into the great sport it is today. Hockey impacts the lives of many kids and people all over the world
who are all training hard to one day be in the NHL.</p>

  <h2>The Creation of The National Hockey Leauge</h2>
  <p>The National Hockey Leauge was formed in 1917 when a group of struggling owners from the National Hockey Association gathered in the Windsor Hotel in Montreal. The first man to emerge from behind
closed doors of the meeting was Frank Calder, who would become president of the new league. Ferguson hollered after him, "Hey Frank, what happened?" "Nothing much," replied Calder. George Kennedy,
owner of the Montreal Canadiens, was more forthcoming: "It's like our old league except that we haven't invited Eddie Livingstone to be part of it," he told Ferguson. Five of the six owners of the
old National Hockey Association had finally gotten tired of the stubborn and confrontational owner of the Toronto Blueshirts, Eddie Livingstone. So they met without him and made a new league
(which officially came into existence on 26 November 1917). Livingstone was "always arguing,” Ottawa manager and co-owner Tommy Gorman said, "Without him we can get down to the business of making money.”
While the leauge was still in its beginning stages, there was a very big problem with player salary. The rising competition for players led to the higher increase in salary and this eventually led
to some teams folding. The league now adopted a salary cap of $5,000. Some people thought that there was a chance of a player union, but in the end most players accepted the salary decrease. There was no
guarantee in 1917 that professional hockey would survive, and no one at the time would have predicted that the National Hockey League would become the premier professional league in
the world.</p>
<p>The leauge survived from 1917 until 1942 with the 6 original Canadian teams. In 1942 the "Original Six" era begins with the creation of The Boston Bruins, Chicago Black Hawks, Detroit
Red Wings, Montreal Canadiens, New York Rangers and Toronto Maple Leafs. Those six teams make up the league for the next 25 seasons and make the foundation for the NHL. The league stayed steady until
the biggest expasnion in sports history happened in 1967. The National Hockey Leauge had now added six more teams to the list. The new teams included: the California Seals (later renamed the Oakland Seals
and then the California Golden Seals), Los Angeles Kings, Minnesota North Stars, Philadelphia Flyers, Pittsburgh Penguins and St. Louis Blues bringing  the NHL from six to 12 teams. In 1970 The NHL
expands to 14 teams by adding the Buffalo Sabres and the Vancouver Canucks. Vancouver had been home to the Millionaires, which won the Stanley Cup in 1915, two years before the founding of the NHL. In 1972
the New York metropolitan area gets a second NHL team and the South gets its first. The New York Islanders join the NHL as do the Atlanta Flames, though the team moves to Calgary in 1980. Next, in 1974,
the pattern of adding of two teams every two years continues when the Washington Capitals and Kansas City Scouts join the NHL. However, the Scouts play only two seasons in Kansas City before moving to
Denver and being renamed the Colorado Rockies. In 1982, the franchise moves again and becomes the New Jersey Devils. Then in 1978 the California Golden Seals move to Cleveland and are renamed the
Barons, and later merge with the North Stars. That reduces the number of teams in the NHL from 18 to 17 and the North Stars move to Dallas in 1993 and are renamed the Stars.In 1979, the NHL takes four
teams from the World Hockey Association. The Edmonton Oilers, Hartford Whalers, Quebec Nordiques and Winnipeg Jets brings the NHL to 21 teams. The Jets move to Phoenix in 1996 and become the Phoenix
(now Arizona) Coyotes, the Nordiques move to Denver in 1995 and are renamed the Colorado Avalanche, and the Whalers relocate in 1997 and are renamed the Carolina Hurricanes, based in Raleigh, N.C. In the
year 1991, the leauge comes to 22 teams with the addition of the San Jose Sharks. With the year 1992, the NHL expands again with the addition of the Ottawa Senators and Tampa Bay Lightning. The original
Senators had played in the NHL from 1917-34. The Lightning are the first NHL franchise in Florida. The next year in 1993, the League adds its 25th and 26th teams, the Florida Panthers (based in Miami) and
Anaheim Mighty Ducks. Five years later in 1998, the Nashville Predators bring the number of teams in the NHL to 27. In the following year of 1999, the NHL returns to Atlanta with the leagues 28th team:
The Atlanta Thrashers. With the NHL expanding again in 2000, the addition of the Columbus Blue Jackets and Minnesota Wild, get the league to 30 teams. The Wild, who play in St. Paul, Minnesota, bring the
NHL back to Minnesota seven years after the North Stars relocated to Dallas. The NHL in Atlanta was short lived when the Thrashers relocated to Winnipeg in 2011. The latest event to occur in the National
Hockey Leauge was in 2016 when Gary Bettman, the commissioner of the NHL, announced that there would be an expansion in Las Vegas for the 2017-18 season. This is the first major professional sports
team in Las Vegas and it also brings the Leauge to 31 teams.</p>
